Text style editor widget for flutter

**Show some ❤️ and star the repo to support the project**

## Notes from aozpolat:

- I edited this repo to use it in [Stencil](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StudioNext.stencil&hl=en_US&gl=US) app that we are building.
- Upgraded the example project to null safety
- Deleted some unnecessary features for Stencil app like toggling caps lock and changing font color.
- Added textfield to the example project so users can type anything they want. 

## Features

- Edit `TextStyle`
- Change `TextAlign`
- Taggle `Caps lock`
